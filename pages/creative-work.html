                ah, Teng is a poetic documentary set in a house in suburban New Jersey where Teng Teng, a mother of two
                daughters, has stage four breast cancer. On September 10th 2019, her daughters found out about the
                cancer ––
                and the fact that it has spread to almost every organ: liver, lung, bone, brain, etc. She died on May
                27th,
                2020. Shot from February 2020 to May 2020, ah, Teng follows Dina, the older sister as she lives in the
                house
                full-time and cares for her mother, and Shana, the younger sister, who travels back-and-forth between
                home
                and college to be with her mother. ah, Teng is directed and created by Shana Kleiner, Teng Teng’s
                youngest
                daughter, and reveals an intimate first-person perspective of what it looks like and feels like to see
                her
                mother die, what it means to navigate loss, and how grieving has implicated the spaces that she calls
                home.

            </div>
            <div class="videoDescription">
                Directed by filmmaker Shawn Kornhauser and produced by Shana Kleiner, Life of Abundance is a short film
                depicting the Black experience surrounding grief, loss, and community healing in Harlem, New York. The
                documentary follows a diverse group of Black Harlem residents, all older adults, who participated in a
                series of focus groups, on grief, hosted by Columbia University. The film follows community members
                where they are most comfortable: their homes, the Church, and their neighborhoods, to discuss the
                intersections of coping with grief, and the reality and banality of grief as an undercurrent to everyday
                life. In light of COVID-19 and so many institutional losses since, Life of Abundance offers a complex
                and poetic snapshot where research and lived experience collide, and how Black people make meaning of
                their own lives after experiencing the death of a loved one.
