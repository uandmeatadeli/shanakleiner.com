                        Shana Kleiner received her Masters in Social Work from Columbia University, and her Bachelors
                        in
                        Social Work from Skidmore College. As a previous policy analyst for a nonprofit providing legal
                        services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence, Shana has expertise with qualitative
                        research methods, advocacy for survivors, and knowledge translation. She is currently the
                        Assistant
                        Director of SAFELab, a transdisciplinary research group drawing on qualitative and computational
                        methods to examine well-being, health equity, and social justice with youth of Color and
                        marginalized communities. In her current role, she researches online grief, as well as
                        theoretical
                        approaches to analyzing digital communication and language. She works with interdisciplinary
                        teams
                        in order to conduct research on digital counterpublics, social work in data science, ethical
                        implications of GenAI, and bias within large language models.

                        Shana’s research interests also include femme online identity performance, particularly in
                        relation
                        to resilience and coping strategies. She is fascinated by the ruptures that are inherently
                        present
                        between digital avatars and real-life selves. She is passionate about work that targets the
                        space
                        in-between: where the digital self and the real self collide and split. Shana was a previous
                        fellow
                        at the MDOCS Storytellers’ Institute, and worked with other artists, writers, and filmmakers
                        surrounding the notion of co-creation. Her personal interests include zines, collaging, vintage
                        shopping, and swimming.
