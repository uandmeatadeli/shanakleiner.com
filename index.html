                    Shana Kleiner is a social work researcher and digital ethnographer studying digital expressions of
                    grief, online identity performance, and cyber-embodiment. She is fascinated by modes of digital
                    healing,
                    reconstruction, and remembrance.

                    Shana Kleiner received her Masters in Social Work from Columbia University, and her Bachelors in
                    Social Work from Skidmore College. As a previous policy analyst for a nonprofit providing legal
                    services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence, Shana has expertise with qualitative
                    research methods, advocacy for survivors, and knowledge translation. She is currently the Assistant
                    Director of SAFELab, a transdisciplinary research group drawing on qualitative and computational
                    methods to examine well-being, health equity, and social justice with youth of Color and
                    marginalized communities. In her current role, she researches online grief, as well as theoretical
                    approaches to analyzing digital communication and language. She works with interdisciplinary teams
                    in order to conduct research on digital counterpublics, social work in data science, ethical
                    implications of GenAI, and bias within large language models.

                    Shana’s research interests also include femme online identity performance, particularly in relation
                    to resilience and coping strategies. She is fascinated by the ruptures that are inherently present
                    between digital avatars and real-life selves. She is passionate about work that targets the space
                    in-between: where the digital self and the real self collide and split. Shana was a previous fellow
                    at the MDOCS Storytellers’ Institute, and worked with other artists, writers, and filmmakers
                    surrounding the notion of co-creation. Her personal interests include zines, collaging, vintage
                    shopping, and swimming.
